# System Design ðŸš€

Welcome to the **System Design** repository!  
This is my personal space to document and share my journey of learning system design â€” one concept at a time.

## ðŸ“˜ About

System design is a critical aspect of building scalable, reliable, and maintainable software systems. This repository serves as a continuously evolving resource where Iâ€™ll be adding:

- Concepts and principles
- High-level design diagrams
- Real-world system design case studies
- Trade-offs, bottlenecks, and optimizations
- Notes from books, courses, and videos
- Practice questions and solutions

All content is written and organized in a way that makes it easy to revise and reference later.

## ðŸ§  Why this repo?

- To deepen my understanding of system design through consistent documentation.
- To track my progress and learning milestones.
- To help others who are also learning system design.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure (Work in Progress)

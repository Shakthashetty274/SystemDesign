# System Design 🚀

Welcome to the **System Design** repository!  
This is my personal space to document and share my journey of learning system design — one concept at a time.

## 📘 About

System design is a critical aspect of building scalable, reliable, and maintainable software systems. This repository serves as a continuously evolving resource where I’ll be adding:

- Concepts and principles
- High-level design diagrams
- Real-world system design case studies
- Trade-offs, bottlenecks, and optimizations
- Notes from books, courses, and videos
- Practice questions and solutions

All content is written and organized in a way that makes it easy to revise and reference later.

## 🧠 Why this repo?

- To deepen my understanding of system design through consistent documentation.
- To track my progress and learning milestones.
- To help others who are also learning system design.

## 📂 Structure (Work in Progress)


📌 Note: This is a growing repository. I will be updating it regularly as I learn at my own pace.
## 🤝 Contributions

While this is a personal learning repo, feel free to open issues or suggestions! I'm happy to collaborate and learn together.
